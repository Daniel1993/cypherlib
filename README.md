# CYPHERLIB

In this library I gathered some cryptografic algorithms that can be compiled with a C11 compatible compiler (pure C, no C++).

The code came from the links/repos below:

WELL RNG: http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~panneton/WELLRNG.html
SHA3: https://github.com/JamisHoo/Cryptographic-Algorithms
AES256: http://www.literatecode.com/aes256
ECC: https://github.com/kmackay/micro-ecc
